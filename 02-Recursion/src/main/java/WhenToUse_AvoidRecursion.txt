When to use/ Avoid Recursion ?


When to use:
    When we can easily beakdown a problem into similar subproblem
    When we are ok with extra overhead(both time and space) that comes with it
    When we need a quick working solution instead of effcient one.


When not to use:
    if the response to any of the above statments is NO, we should not go with recursion.
