What is 'Algo Run Time Analysis'?
- it is a study of a fiven algorithm's running time, by identifying its
    behavior as the input size for the algorithm increases, in a layman's
    language we can say, 'how much time will the given algorithm will take to run'


Whay should we learn this?

to measure 'efficiency' of a given algorithm
if we don't learn this topic, this is how our program would look like
